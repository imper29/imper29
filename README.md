Hello world,

I love that the more you know about computers, the less you'll trust them.<br/>
I love that regex is running in more than zero kernel level drivers.<br/>
I love that this expression ^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$ finds primes.<br/>
I love the boundless nature of the windows api.<br/>
I love the reiliability of modern game engines.<br/>
I dare say, today's software is incredible!<br/>
<br/>
Jokes aside, I love making software that makes people happy.<br/>
Sometimes applications work well and feel good to use.<br/>
Those applications make people happy.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently developing a videogame called Splat Zone.<br/>
