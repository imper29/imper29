Hello world,

I love that the more you know about computers, the less you'll trust them.\n
I love that regex is running in more than zero kernel level drivers.\n
I love that this expression ^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$ finds primes.\n
I love the boundless nature of the windows api.\n
I love the reiliability of modern game engines.\n
I dare say, today's software is incredible!\n

Jokes aside, I love making software that makes people happy.
Sometimes applications work well and feel good to use.
Those applications make people happy.

I am currently developing a videogame called Splat Zone.
